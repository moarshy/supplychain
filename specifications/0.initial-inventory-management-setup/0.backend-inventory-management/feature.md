# Backend Inventory Management Feature

## Overview
This feature establishes the foundational backend infrastructure for the AI4SupplyChain inventory management system using FastAPI, SQLModel, and SQLite. It implements a layered architecture with comprehensive CRUD operations for products, inventory tracking, locations, suppliers, and transactions.

## Business Value

### For AI4SupplyChain System
- Provides robust data foundation for all inventory operations
- Enables real-time inventory tracking across multiple locations
- Supports supplier relationship management and performance tracking
- Creates complete audit trail for all inventory movements
- Establishes scalable architecture for future AI and optimization features

### For End-Users
- Real-time visibility into stock levels across all locations
- Complete transaction history and audit trail
- Supplier management with lead time and performance tracking
- Foundation for automated reorder recommendations
- Data validation and integrity ensuring accurate inventory records

## Important Context
All paths provided in this document are relative to the project root directory unless otherwise specified.

### Current Implementation
This is a greenfield implementation creating the initial backend infrastructure. The system follows the 4-layer architecture defined in the Software_Architecture.md:
- **Layer 1**: Data Foundation (`backend/src/data/`) - SQLModel models and database
- **Layer 2**: Business Logic (`backend/src/services/`) - Core business operations  
- **Layer 3**: AI Agent (`backend/src/agent/`) - Conversational AI system (future phase)
- **Layer 4**: API (`backend/src/api/`) - FastAPI REST endpoints

### Technical Foundation
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLModel ORM for type-safe data models
- **API Framework**: FastAPI for automatic documentation and validation
- **Package Manager**: UV for ultra-fast dependency management
- **Configuration**: Centralized config.py for all backend settings

### Data Model Architecture
The system implements five core entities with relationships:
- Products (master data) ’ Suppliers (many-to-one)
- Inventory (stock levels) ’ Products + Locations (composite)
- Transactions (movements) ’ Products + Locations (many-to-one each)
- Locations (warehouses) ’ Independent master data

## User Stories
(Backend API focused - frontend integration stories in next feature)

### System Administrator
1. **Database Setup**: **Given** a fresh installation, **when** the system starts, **then** all database tables are automatically created with proper relationships and constraints.

2. **Configuration Management**: **Given** different deployment environments, **when** configuration is loaded, **then** appropriate database paths and settings are applied from config.py.

### Inventory Manager (via API)
1. **Product Management**: **Given** new products need to be added, **when** I create products via API, **then** they are validated and stored with proper supplier relationships and reorder parameters.

2. **Stock Tracking**: **Given** inventory levels change, **when** transactions are processed, **then** inventory quantities are automatically updated across all affected locations with complete audit trail.

3. **Location Management**: **Given** multiple warehouses, **when** I manage locations via API, **then** each location maintains independent inventory levels for all products.

### API Consumer (Frontend/External Systems)
1. **Real-time Data**: **Given** current inventory data is needed, **when** I query inventory endpoints, **then** I receive accurate, real-time stock levels with location details.

2. **Transaction Processing**: **Given** inventory movements occur, **when** I submit transaction data, **then** the system validates and processes them with automatic inventory level updates.

3. **Supplier Integration**: **Given** supplier information is needed, **when** I access supplier endpoints, **then** I get complete supplier data including lead times and performance metrics.

## Next Steps
- Implement SQLModel data models following defined schema
- Create service layer with CRUD operations and business logic
- Develop FastAPI endpoints with proper validation and error handling
- Set up database initialization and configuration management
- Write comprehensive tests for all layers
- Generate sample data for development and testing
- Ready for frontend integration (next feature)

## Open Questions & Risks

### Technical Decisions
- UUID vs Integer primary keys for better distributed system support
- Soft delete vs hard delete approach for master data
- Optimistic vs pessimistic locking for inventory updates
- Database indexing strategy for optimal query performance

### Business Rules
- Should reserved quantities block available inventory calculations?
- How should negative inventory be handled (backorders vs hard stops)?
- What validation rules apply to bulk transaction imports?
- Should supplier performance metrics be calculated in real-time or batch?

### Integration Considerations
- API versioning strategy for future frontend compatibility
- Error response format standardization across all endpoints
- Data export format preferences for external system integration
- Webhook requirements for real-time system notifications
